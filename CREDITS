Thanks to Tobias Oetiker, the author of RRD, for his very
useful tool. Without RRD, Cricket would be useless.

The genDevConfig script is based on the hard work of:

MRTG 2.8.8 cfgmaker by Tobias Oetiker 
Cricket 0.71 listInterface by Jeff Allen
genRtrConfig 1.4 by Mike Fisher

It was initially developped and integrated by Mike Fisher, who
released the first public version of genRtrConfig on sourceforge
(version 1.4).

The script was further developped under the genRtrConfig name by Francois Mikus. As the script evolved the name was changed to genDevConfig
to reflect the new scope and mechanic.

This script would not be where it is right now without the involvement of these fine people.
